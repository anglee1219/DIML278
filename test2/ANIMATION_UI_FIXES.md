# Animation and UI Interaction Fixes

## Problem Identified
- **Sheet covering animation**: When notification opened the app, some modal state was triggering sheets to appear over the animation
- **Unresponsive navigation**: Bottom nav bar and back button became unresponsive after notification flow
- **State conflicts**: Notification state was interfering with normal UI interactions

## Root Cause
The notification handling was changing app state in a way that triggered modals/sheets and left the app in an inconsistent navigation state, preventing proper user interaction.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Modal State Reset on Notification Entry
**Location**: `GroupDetailView.onAppear`
```swift
// CRITICAL: Reset all modal/sheet states when appearing from notification
if cameFromNotification {
    print("üîî üéØ RESETTING ALL MODAL STATES FROM NOTIFICATION")
    showCamera = false
    showSettings = false
    showComments = false
    showPermissionAlert = false
    showError = false
    selectedEntryForComments = nil
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Back Button with State Cleanup
**Location**: `topBarView` back button
- Added notification state cleanup before dismiss
- Reset all modal states to prevent conflicts
- Ensures clean navigation when leaving view

### 3. Bottom Navigation Protection
**Location**: `bottomNavigationView`
- Clear notification state before any navigation
- Added cleanup in both tab change and camera tap handlers
- Prevents navigation conflicts

### 4. Camera Permission Delay
**Location**: `checkCameraPermission()`
- Detect if notification animation is in progress
- Delay camera permission check by 5 seconds if needed
- Prevents camera sheet from covering unlock animation

### 5. Comprehensive onDisappear Cleanup
**Location**: `onDisappear`
- Clean up all notification state when leaving view
- Reset all animation states
- Prevent lingering state that could affect future visits

### 6. Extended Animation Timing
**Location**: `onAppear` notification handling
- Increased initial delay to 1.5 seconds (from 0.8s)
- Longer cleanup delays to ensure animations complete
- Better coordination between scroll and animation

## Key State Variables Managed

### Notification States:
- `cameFromNotification`
- `shouldTriggerNotificationUnlock` 
- `notificationPrompt`

### Modal/Sheet States:
- `showCamera`
- `showSettings`
- `showComments`
- `showPermissionAlert`
- `showError`
- `selectedEntryForComments`

### Animation States:
- `showNewPromptCard`
- `hasUnlockedNewPrompt`
- `isUnlockingPrompt`
- `animateCountdownRefresh`
- `hasTriggeredUnlockForCurrentPrompt`
- `hasNewPromptReadyForAnimation`
- `showPromptCompletedFeedback`
- `showNewPromptUnlockedFeedback`
- `shouldAutoScrollToPrompt`

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Notification Tap**: App opens and navigates to group
2. **Clean View**: No sheets or modals cover the animation
3. **Animation Plays**: Smooth auto-scroll ‚Üí vibration ‚Üí unlock animation
4. **Responsive UI**: All buttons and navigation work normally
5. **Clean Exit**: Back button and bottom nav work without issues
