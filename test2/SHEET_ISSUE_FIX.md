# Sheet Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
When tapping a notification outside the app, a green "Prompt unlocking" sheet was appearing and covering the chat screen, preventing the user from seeing the unlock animation properly.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **duplicate notification navigation handling** in both the main app (`test2App.swift`) and the intended location (`MainTabView.swift`). This created navigation conflicts where:

1. Main app tried to show `GroupDetailViewWrapper` directly in the top-level navigation
2. MainTabView also tried to handle the same notification 
3. This caused the view to appear as a sheet/modal instead of proper navigation
4. The unlock feedback banner was shown immediately, making it appear as a sheet

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Moved Navigation Handling to MainTabView
**Before**: Navigation was handled in `test2App.swift` which replaced the entire navigation stack
**After**: Navigation is now properly handled in `MainTabView.swift` which shows the group view within the normal app flow

### 2. Removed Duplicate Notification Listeners
**Location**: `test2App.swift`
- Removed the `.onReceive` listeners for "NavigateToGroupAndUnlock" and "NavigateToGroup"
- Removed navigation state variables that were causing conflicts
- Now MainTabView handles all notification navigation

### 3. Improved State Management
**Location**: `GroupDetailView.swift`
- Added feedback states to the modal reset list
- Delayed unlock feedback banner until after animation starts
- Better cleanup of notification states

### 4. Enhanced Navigation Flow
**Location**: `MainTabView.swift`
- Added proper notification handling with state management
- Uses conditional rendering to show GroupDetailView within normal navigation
- Prevents navigation conflicts that cause sheet appearance

## Technical Changes Made

### test2App.swift
```swift
// REMOVED: Duplicate navigation state
// @State private var shouldNavigateToGroup = false
// @State private var targetGroupId: String?
// @State private var shouldTriggerUnlock = false
// @State private var notificationUserInfo: [String: Any] = [:]

// REMOVED: Duplicate notification listeners
// .onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: NSNotification.Name("NavigateToGroupAndUnlock")))
// .onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: NSNotification.Name("NavigateToGroup")))

// SIMPLIFIED: Always show MainTabView
NavigationStack {
    MainTabView(currentTab: .home)
        .environmentObject(groupStore)
}
```

### MainTabView.swift
```swift
// ADDED: Proper notification navigation handling
@State private var shouldNavigateToGroup = false
@State private var targetGroupId: String?
@State private var shouldTriggerUnlock = false
@State private var notificationUserInfo: [String: Any] = [:]

// ADDED: Conditional navigation within normal flow
if shouldNavigateToGroup, let groupId = targetGroupId {
    GroupDetailViewWrapper(
        groupId: groupId,
        groupStore: groupStore,
        shouldTriggerUnlock: shouldTriggerUnlock,
        notificationUserInfo: notificationUserInfo
    )
} else {
    // Normal tab content
}
```

### GroupDetailView.swift
```swift
// ADDED: Reset feedback states that might appear as sheets
if cameFromNotification {
    showPromptCompletedFeedback = false
    showNewPromptUnlockedFeedback = false
    isRefreshing = false
}

// MODIFIED: Delay unlock feedback until after animation
// Don't show immediately, wait until animation starts
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Tap Notification**: App opens normally to MainTabView
2. **Smooth Navigation**: GroupDetailView appears within normal navigation flow (not as sheet)
3. **Clean Animation**: Auto-scroll â†’ vibration â†’ unlock animation plays without interference
4. **No Sheets**: No green banner appears as a sheet over the content
5. **Responsive UI**: All navigation and buttons work normally

## Debug Messages to Look For

- `ðŸ”” ðŸŽ¯ MainTabView received NavigateToGroupAndUnlock`
- `ðŸ”” ðŸŽ¯ MainTabView navigating to group: [groupId]`
- `ðŸ”” ðŸŽ¯ RESETTING ALL MODAL STATES FROM NOTIFICATION`
- `ðŸ”” ðŸŽ¯ ðŸ“¢ Now showing unlock feedback banner` (should appear after animation, not before)

## Testing Checklist

1. âœ… Tap notification â†’ app opens to normal view (not sheet)
2. âœ… Auto-scroll and unlock animation play smoothly  
3. âœ… No green sheet covers the chat screen
4. âœ… Unlock feedback banner appears after animation (not as sheet)
5. âœ… All navigation remains responsive
6. âœ… Back button works normally
7. âœ… Can navigate away and return without issues
