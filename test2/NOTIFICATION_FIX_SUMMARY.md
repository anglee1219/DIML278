# Notification and Animation Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Notification System Issue
**Problem**: Notifications were being sent to all devices instead of just the influencer
**Solution**: 
- Fixed `EntryStore.scheduleNextPromptUnlockNotification()` to only schedule notifications for the current user if they are the influencer
- Added proper checks for `currentUserId == currentInfluencerId`
- Improved notification cancellation to prevent duplicates

### 2. Animation and Auto-Scroll Issues
**Problem**: Animation and auto-scroll weren't working from notifications
**Solution**:
- Simplified the notification handling logic in `GroupDetailView.onAppear`
- Fixed timing issues with sequential animations
- Improved auto-scroll targeting

## Key Changes Made

### EntryStore.swift
1. **Fixed notification targeting**:
   ```swift
   // BEFORE: Scheduled for any user who uploaded
   private func scheduleNextPromptUnlockNotification(for userId: String, groupMembers: [String])
   
   // AFTER: Only schedules for current user if they're the influencer
   func scheduleNextPromptUnlockNotification()
   ```

2. **Added proper influencer check**:
   ```swift
   guard currentUserId == currentInfluencerId else {
       print("üì± ‚è≠Ô∏è ‚ÑπÔ∏è Current user is not influencer, not scheduling notification")
       return
   }
   ```

3. **Enhanced notification metadata**:
   - Added `promptFrequency` and `unlockTime` to notification data
   - Improved notification identifiers for better tracking
   - Added duplicate notification prevention

### GroupDetailView.swift
1. **Simplified onAppear logic**:
   - Moved `loadDailyPrompt()` to happen first for all cases
   - Reduced complexity in notification handling flow
   - Fixed timing delays for animations

2. **Improved auto-scroll timing**:
   ```swift
   // BEFORE: Multiple complex timing chains
   // AFTER: Simple sequential timing
   DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.8) { /* scroll */ }
   DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1.2) { /* animate */ }
   ```

3. **Enhanced haptic feedback**:
   - Added heavy haptic feedback for notification unlocks
   - Proper timing with animation sequences

## How It Works Now

### For Influencer Upload:
1. **Influencer uploads photo** ‚Üí `EntryStore.addEntry()` called
2. **After successful upload** ‚Üí `scheduleNextPromptUnlockNotification()` called
3. **Check**: Only proceeds if current user is the influencer
4. **Schedule**: Local notification set for next prompt unlock time
5. **Result**: Only the influencer gets the notification on their device

### For Notification Tap:
1. **User taps notification** ‚Üí `AppDelegate.handlePromptUnlockNotification()` 
2. **Navigation**: App navigates to specific group with unlock flags
3. **GroupDetailView**: Detects notification flags in `onAppear`
4. **Sequence**: Auto-scroll ‚Üí Haptic feedback ‚Üí Unlock animation
5. **Cleanup**: Reset notification flags after animation

## Testing Instructions

### Test Notification Targeting:
1. **Setup**: Have two devices logged in as different users
2. **Upload**: Have the influencer upload a photo
3. **Verify**: Only the influencer should get the unlock notification (not other users)
4. **Check Console**: Look for logs like "üì± ‚è≠Ô∏è ‚úÖ Current user IS the influencer"

### Test Animation Flow:
1. **Upload**: Upload as influencer and wait for unlock time
2. **Background**: Put app in background
3. **Notification**: Tap the "üéâ New Prompt Unlocked!" notification
4. **Verify**: App should:
   - Navigate to group chat
   - Auto-scroll to countdown timer
   - Show heavy vibration
   - Animate timer ‚Üí prompt card transformation
   - Show unlock feedback banner

## Debug Logging

Look for these console messages to verify fixes:

**Notification Scheduling**:
- `üì± ‚è≠Ô∏è ‚úÖ Current user IS the influencer - proceeding with scheduling`
- `üì± ‚è≠Ô∏è ‚úÖ Successfully scheduled prompt unlock notification!`

**Notification Handling**:
- `üîî üéØ === HANDLING NOTIFICATION UNLOCK FLOW ===`
- `üîî üéØ üìç Auto-scrolling to countdown timer...`
- `üîî üéØ üé¨ TRIGGERING UNLOCK ANIMATION WITH VIBRATION!`

**Animation Flow**:
- `üé¨ ===== STARTING ENHANCED PROMPT UNLOCK ANIMATION SEQUENCE =====`
- `üé¨ Heavy haptic feedback triggered!`

## Files Modified

1. **test2/DIMLGroup/EntryStore.swift**
   - Fixed notification targeting to influencer only
   - Improved notification scheduling logic
   - Enhanced metadata and duplicate prevention

2. **test2/DIMLGroupScreens/GroupDetailView.swift**
